### Title: Gemini 3 Flash & Antigravity: The Era of Agentic Coding is Here

The landscape of AI development is shifting from "chat with code" to "agents that build." Today’s updates from Google mark a massive leap in this direction.

#### 1. Gemini 3 Flash: Speed Meets Precision
Google has brought **Gemini 3 Flash** to the Gemini CLI. Why does this matter? It hits a **76% SWE-bench Verified** score—offering Pro-grade performance for agentic coding but with the low latency and cost efficiency needed for high-frequency tasks. If you're building agents that need to iterate fast, this is your new engine.

#### 2. Google Antigravity (Preview)
Imagine an orchestrator that lives across your editor, terminal, and browser. **Google Antigravity** is a new agentic development platform designed to plan, execute, and verify tasks. It uses "Artifacts" to track progress, making complex multi-step workflows transparent and manageable.

#### 3. Enterprise Power with GEAR
For those scaling beyond personal projects, the **Gemini Enterprise Agent Ready (GEAR)** program is launching to help organizations build and scale AI agents effectively.

🚀 **The Agentic Revolution is Accelerating!**

Google just dropped a massive set of updates for AI developers. Here’s the breakdown:

🔹 **Gemini 3 Flash** is now in the Gemini CLI. Pro-level coding (76% SWE-bench) at Flash speeds.
🔹 **Google Antigravity** (Preview) is a new platform for orchestrating agents across your dev environment.
🔹 **Vertex AI** got a massive performance boost (35% latency reduction) and now hosts **Claude Opus 4.6**.
🔹 **LiteRT** is evolving as the universal framework for on-device AI, running 1.4x faster on GPUs.

Whether you're building serverless inference on Cloud Run with NVIDIA RTX 6000s or scaling enterprise agents with the new GEAR program, the tools are getting faster, cheaper, and smarter.

🧵 Huge day for AI Devs! Google just leveled up the ecosystem:

1/ Gemini 3 Flash is now in the Gemini CLI! ⚡️ 76% SWE-bench Verified performance at low latency. Perfect for high-frequency agentic coding. #GeminiAI

2/ Introducing **Google Antigravity** (Preview)! 🛰️ A new platform to orchestrate agents across your editor, terminal, and browser. Uses "Artifacts" to track complex plans and execution.

3/ Cloud Run + NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs = High-performance serverless inference. ☁️ Plus, Vertex AI latency is down 35% thanks to the new GKE Inference Gateway.

4/ LiteRT (formerly TFLite) is now the universal framework for on-device AI. 📱 1.4x faster GPU performance and better NPU support for Gemma models.

The era of agents isn't coming—it's here. Which update is the biggest win for your workflow? 🚀
