## 🚀 The Sovereign Agent: Building with Gemini 3 Pro and Google Antigravity
The frontier of AI development has moved past "prompt engineering" and into "agent orchestration." With the simultaneous release of **Gemini 3 Pro** in the CLI and the **Google Antigravity** platform, developers now have the raw reasoning power and the execution framework necessary to build truly autonomous systems.

### 1. Gemini 3 Pro: The Brain of the Operation
The integration of Gemini 3 Pro into the Gemini CLI brings state-of-the-art reasoning to the local terminal. Unlike its faster sibling, Flash, Pro is designed for high-stakes problem solving:
*   **Agentic Coding**: Executing complex shell commands and debugging live services (e.g., Cloud Run) in real-time.
*   **Multimodal Reasoning**: Generating 3D applications from rough hand-drawn sketches.

### 2. Google Antigravity: The Execution Engine
If Gemini 3 is the brain, **Antigravity** is the nervous system. This new agentic development platform allows agents to autonomously plan and verify tasks across the editor, terminal, and browser.
*   **Artifact-Based Verification**: Using screenshots and recordings to ensure the agent's progress matches the developer's intent.

### 3. Real-World Workflows: Open Frameworks
To accelerate adoption, Google has partnered with frameworks like **ADK, Agno, Browser Use, and mem0** to showcase production-ready workflows for deep search and stateful enterprise automation.
