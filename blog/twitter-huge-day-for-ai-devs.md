🧵 Huge day for AI Devs! Google just leveled up the ecosystem:

1/ Gemini 3 Flash is now in the Gemini CLI! ⚡️ 76% SWE-bench Verified performance at low latency. Perfect for high-frequency agentic coding. #GeminiAI

2/ Introducing **Google Antigravity** (Preview)! 🛰️ A new platform to orchestrate agents across your editor, terminal, and browser. Uses "Artifacts" to track complex plans and execution.

3/ Cloud Run + NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs = High-performance serverless inference. ☁️ Plus, Vertex AI latency is down 35% thanks to the new GKE Inference Gateway.

4/ LiteRT (formerly TFLite) is now the universal framework for on-device AI. 📱 1.4x faster GPU performance and better NPU support for Gemma models.

The era of agents isn't coming—it's here. Which update is the biggest win for your workflow? 🚀
