## 🚀 The Full Stack Agent: From Gemini 3.1 Pro to Google Antigravity
The AI landscape took a leap forward with the launch of **Gemini 3.1 Pro** and the expansion of the **Google Antigravity** platform. This combined stack provides the intelligence and the execution framework for high-stakes, autonomous development.

### 1. Gemini 3.1 Pro: Enterprise-Grade Reasoning
Launched today, **Gemini 3.1 Pro** is now available across the Gemini CLI, Gemini Enterprise, and Vertex AI. It represents the latest evolution in reasoning power, specifically optimized for developer workflows and complex enterprise-grade automation.
*   **Availability**: CLI, Vertex AI, Enterprise.

### 2. Google Antigravity: The Agentic Control Plane
The **Google Antigravity** platform has transitioned into public preview. It’s no longer a concept but a functional "Manager Surface" where agents can plan, execute, and verify tasks autonomously across your entire development environment—editor, terminal, and browser.
*   **Key Feature**: Autonomous verification of intent vs. outcome.

### 3. Ecosystem Synergy: Local & Edge
Complementing the cloud power of Gemini 3.1 is the evolution of **LiteRT** (formerly TFLite). With 1.4x faster GPU performance, it brings powerful on-device AI capabilities to the edge, ensuring that agentic workflows can remain responsive regardless of connectivity.
