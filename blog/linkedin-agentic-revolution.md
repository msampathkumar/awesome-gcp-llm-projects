🚀 **The Agentic Revolution is Accelerating!**

Google just dropped a massive set of updates for AI developers. Here’s the breakdown:

🔹 **Gemini 3 Flash** is now in the Gemini CLI. Pro-level coding (76% SWE-bench) at Flash speeds.
🔹 **Google Antigravity** (Preview) is a new platform for orchestrating agents across your dev environment.
🔹 **Vertex AI** got a massive performance boost (35% latency reduction) and now hosts **Claude Opus 4.6**.
🔹 **LiteRT** is evolving as the universal framework for on-device AI, running 1.4x faster on GPUs.

Whether you're building serverless inference on Cloud Run with NVIDIA RTX 6000s or scaling enterprise agents with the new GEAR program, the tools are getting faster, cheaper, and smarter.
