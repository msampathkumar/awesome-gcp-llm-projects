The landscape of AI development is shifting from "chat with code" to "agents that build." Today’s updates from Google mark a massive leap in this direction.

### 1. Gemini 3 Flash: Speed Meets Precision
Google has brought **Gemini 3 Flash** to the Gemini CLI. Why does this matter? It hits a **76% SWE-bench Verified** score—offering Pro-grade performance for agentic coding but with the low latency and cost efficiency needed for high-frequency tasks. If you're building agents that need to iterate fast, this is your new engine.

### 2. Google Antigravity (Preview)
Imagine an orchestrator that lives across your editor, terminal, and browser. **Google Antigravity** is a new agentic development platform designed to plan, execute, and verify tasks. It uses "Artifacts" to track progress, making complex multi-step workflows transparent and manageable.

### 3. Enterprise Power with GEAR
For those scaling beyond personal projects, the **Gemini Enterprise Agent Ready (GEAR)** program is launching to help organizations build and scale AI agents effectively.
