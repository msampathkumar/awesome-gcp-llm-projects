## 🛠️ Medium Impact: The Developer’s Toolkit for Acceleration

A robust ecosystem of tools supports this rapid progress, designed to make developers faster, more efficient, and more reliable.

*   **Train Models Faster, For Free**: Hugging Face's partnership with **Unsloth** allows for ~2x faster LLM fine-tuning with ~60% less VRAM, and they're offering free credits on Hugging Face Jobs to get started.
    *   *Citation*: [Hugging Face Blog: Unsloth Jobs](https://huggingface.co/blog/unsloth-jobs) (February 20, 2026)
*   **The Future of Local AI is Secure**: The team behind **GGML and llama.cpp**, critical projects for local inference, has joined Hugging Face, ensuring their long-term stability and growth within the open-source community.
    *   *Citation*: [Hugging Face Blog: GGML Joins HF](https://huggingface.co/blog/ggml-joins-hf) (February 20, 2026)
*   **One-Shot Web Apps**: Gradio 6's new `gr.HTML` component allows for rapid prototyping of custom web components and even full applications within a single Python file, perfect for "vibe coding" with LLMs.
    *   *Citation*: [Hugging Face Blog: Gradio HTML Apps](https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio-html-one-shot-apps) (February 18, 2026)
*   **Why Agents Fail**: Crucial research from IBM and UC Berkeley, using the **IT-Bench and MAST** framework, diagnoses common failure points in enterprise agents. The top issue: "incorrect verification," where agents fail to check their work against ground truth—a problem Phil Schmid calls "closing the loop."
